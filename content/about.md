I’m a Software Engineer with over 4 years of experience building high-quality web applications and scalable systems. I specialize in creating solutions that are clean, efficient, and focused on real impact. Throughout my career, I’ve worked across the full stack, contributing to projects from architecture and backend services to modern, intuitive front-end interfaces.

Recently, I’ve been expanding my path into machine learning. Exploring LLMs, model training workflows, and MLOps to better understand how AI systems are built, deployed, and optimized at scale.

I’m passionate about solving complex problems, learning new technologies, and delivering products that make a difference. I enjoy working in fast-paced environments, collaborating with teams, and continuously improving my craft.
